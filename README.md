# Linux In A Box 
## A Linux learning lab deployment solution

The purpose of this project is to leverage the excellent work of 
Daniel Johnson, Aaron Southerland, and others to make it more 
portable, and easier to deploy and maintain.

The long term goal will be to deploy a Linux learning environment
that is versatile and "real world" enough to be useful for a
wide range of exerience levels and educational goals.
This environment could be useful for anyone with a need to learn
more about Linux, whether the learner needs an introductory course
or is preparing for an engineer level certification.

I invite collaborators to help find the ideal combination of 
easy-to-use automation and configuration tools to make this same 
environment easily deployable across multiple platforms, both 
bare metal and virtualized with equal ease.  Simplifying the 
configuration and deployment of our Linux learning labs has 
many advantages for every stakeholder, instructor, learner, 
and our bottom line financaially.  Complexity equals expense, 
and the promise of Agile methodologies, DevOps processes, and 
powerful automation tools like Ansible, Vagrant, and others will 
ultimately result in simplicity, extremely high quality, and 
global consistency of experience while still allowing a capable 
instructor the flexibilty to delivery a variety of classes from 
a single lab platform.  Students could even deploy the exact same 
lab environment they used on classroom servers running VKM virtual 
machines on their systems - regardless of whether they are using 
Virtual Box, HyperV, or a Linux laptop with KVM. (Support for 
nested virtualization would probably be a hard requirement, but 
let's save the technicals for if/when we can get some traction.)
