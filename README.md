# Linux In A Box 
## A Linux learning lab deployment solution

The purpose of this project is to leverage the excellent work of 
Daniel Johnson, Aaron Southerland, and others to make it more 
portable, and easier to deploy and maintain.

The long term goal will be to deploy a learning environment by 
simply installing with a kickstart file pulled directly from
github with a shortened URL like tinyurl.com/LIABTESTING.
